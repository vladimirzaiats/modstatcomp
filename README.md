- data: datasets
- code: auxiliary R code


INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING AND UPDATING THE COURSE MATERIALS

If you're new to GitHub, the easiest option is to click on "Code" and download a zip file with all materials. However, I do not recomment this as you would need to repeat the process every time that I upload the materials! Instead, I suggest that you install GitHub desktop and use that to keep the materials up to date. Please follow the steps below.

1. Install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com
2. After installing it, open GitHub Desktop on your computer
3. Click on "Clone repository". Go to tab "URL" and at "Repository URL" type "https://github.com/vladimirzaiats/modstatcomp" (you can also change the default directory in your computer where the repository will be saved). Click on "Clone".
4. You now have a copy of the statcomp repository in your computer. You can open and view the files normally.
5. To update the repository to the latest contents I posted there, within GitHub Desktop click on "Fetch origin". If there are any updates you will see an option "Pull origin", click on it and you're done!

Note: do not edit the repository files in your computer. If you do, next time they're updated your edits will clash with mine. If you wish to edit them, the easiest option is that you copy them in a separate directory in your computer that is not synced with GitHub (alternatively, if you're experienced with GitHub you can create your own fork)
